## Dynamic Gas Integration for IOTA Move
### Removing the hassle of gas fees for new users
Jumping into a new blockchain ecosystem can be a right faff, especially when you're trying to get hold of the native token just to pay for gas fees. In an effort to smoothen the onboarding experience for users getting into the IOTA Move ecosystem, we've crafted **Dynamic Gas**.

Dynamic Gas lets users settle their transaction fees using custom tokens they’ve got—like those they get in an airdrop or during onboarding—without having to jump through hoops to grab a separate gas token. This approach offers a seamless, user-friendly experience that’s bang on for those who want to avoid the usual complexities.

### How It Works
Leveraging IOTA's core features, such as **Sponsored Transactions** and **Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTB)**, we’ve made it possible for users to cover all gas fees with their own custom tokens. Essentially, a sponsor fronts the native gas for the transaction, and the user pays back in their token of choice. All of this happens behind the scenes, so users don’t have to worry about the specifics.

In a nutshell, here’s what’s going on:

- **Custom Token Payments**: Users can pay for all transaction fees with a single token—be it an airdrop or onboarding token—without needing the native token.
- **Seamless Experience**: No need for users to acquire or convert tokens just for paying fees. Everything happens in one go, making the process slick and stress-free.
- **Sponsored Transactions**: We’ve integrated IOTA’s sponsored transaction system to ensure the native gas is covered, and the user’s chosen token is used to settle up in the background.
